# my-movie-list
This is my final project of SI 507 Intermediate Programming. 
I made a website to store movie information for future access. 
Data comes from The Open Movie Database: OMDb API. Api keys can be accessed from https://www.omdbapi.com/
Required Python packages: json, requests, flask
Data Structure: Binary Search Tree. The keys are the years of the movie, values are the lists of movies of certain year.
